# 📬 Smart Mailbox (ESP32 + ESP32-CAM)

A microcontroller-based smart mailbox that detects mail delivery and captures images locally using sensors and an ESP32-CAM.

The complete system integrated into a standard outdoor mailbox.
All electronics, sensors and camera modules are mounted internally and adapted for outdoor operation.

When a delivery is detected, internal lighting is activated and an image is captured automatically.

## 🧠 System Overview

</p>

This view shows the internal system layout without the mailbox enclosure.

### Main components:

* ESP32 (main controller)
* ESP32-CAM (camera module)
* IR sensor (mail detection)
* Microswitch (door detection)
* LED lighting system
* Relay and power electronics

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The mailbox door opens → detected by microswitch
2. Mail passes into the box → detected by IR sensor
3. ESP32 validates the event
4. LED lighting turns on
5. ESP32-CAM captures an image
6. Image is displayed via local web interface

The combination of sensors improves detection reliability compared to using a single sensor.

A custom-designed PCB is used to:

* simplify wiring
* improve system reliability
* integrate power distribution and signal routing

## 📦 Enclosures (Kapslingar)

### Main enclosure

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/huvudlada_sprangd.png" width="500">
</p>

Contains:

* ESP32
* power electronics
* relay module

---

### Secondary enclosure

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/sekundarlada_sprangd.png" width="500">
</p>

Contains:

* ESP32-CAM
* camera module
* lighting system

## 🏗️ Physical Installation

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/framifran.png" width="45%">
  <img src="images/bakifran.png" width="45%">
</p>

The system is mounted directly inside the mailbox with carefully planned placement of sensors, camera and electronics.

## 🧩 Hardware Design Considerations

* Dual-sensor detection increases robustness
* Components are physically separated to reduce interference
* Electronics are protected using sealed enclosures
* Custom PCB reduces wiring complexity
* Lighting is required due to low internal brightness
