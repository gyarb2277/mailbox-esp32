#  Smart Mailbox (ESP32 + ESP32-CAM)

A microcontroller-based smart mailbox that detects mail delivery and captures images locally using sensors and an ESP32-CAM.
The complete system is integrated into a standard outdoor mailbox.
All electronics, sensors and camera modules are mounted internally and adapted for outdoor operation.

##  System in Operation

When a delivery is detected, internal lighting is activated and an image is captured automatically.

##  System Overview

This view shows the internal system layout without the mailbox enclosure.

### Main components:

* ESP32 (main controller)
* ESP32-CAM (camera module)
* IR sensor (mail detection)
* Microswitch (door detection)
* LED lighting system
* Relay and power electronics

---

##  How It Works

1. The mailbox door opens → detected by microswitch
2. Mail passes into the box → detected by IR sensor
3. ESP32 validates the event
4. LED lighting turns on
5. ESP32-CAM captures an image
6. Image is displayed via local web interface

The combination of sensors improves detection reliability compared to using a single sensor.

A custom-designed PCB is used to:

* simplify wiring
* improve system reliability
* integrate power distribution and signal routing

##  Enclosures

### Main enclosure

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/huvudlåda_sprängd.png" width="500">
</p>

Contains:

* ESP32
* power electronics
* relay module

---

### Secondary enclosure

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/sekundärlada_sprängd.png" width="500">
</p>

Contains:

* ESP32-CAM
* camera module
* lighting system

</p>

The system is mounted directly inside the mailbox with carefully planned placement of sensors, camera and electronics.

##  Hardware Design Considerations

* Dual-sensor detection increases robustness
* Components are physically separated to reduce interference
* Electronics are protected using sealed enclosures
* Custom PCB reduces wiring complexity
* Lighting is required due to low internal brightness

---

##  Setup

1. Flash code to:

   * ESP32 (main unit)
   * ESP32-CAM

2. Configure:

   * WiFi credentials
   * IP address for camera

3. Power the system using external supply

4. Access the system via local web interface

---

##  Future Improvements

* Improved timing between sensors and image capture
* Notification system (mobile / email)
* Higher image resolution
* Battery-powered operation

---

## Project Context

This project was developed as part of a school engineering project and could later be improved in many ways.

* Embedded systems
* Sensor integration
* Wireless communication
